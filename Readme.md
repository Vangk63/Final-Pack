### Purpose: 
Final-Pack

### Expected Grade: 
C-

### Grade Justification: 

This semester has been a very tough year and semester for me. I try to refrain myself from telling people about my history because the world is not a nice place and I am a very cautious person about who I trust. I also don't normally enjoy making excuses or use my life struggles as excuses, but since it may determine what my final grade is then I will provide my history leading to the reason for my actions this semester.

I am a six-year Army veteran with one tour overseas in Iraq. After my tour in Iraq, due to wearing my body armor for excess amount of time, I've experienced some back pain and at which I was then diagnosed with a herniated disc. I was also diagnosed with Patellofemoral pain syndrome in my knee, bad shoulders, and neck pain. Being in the Infantry, we don't tend to show our weaknesses or show people that we have issues, it was a pride ego that I've obtained from being in the military.

Late Spring, early Summer, of this year, I recently accepted a job offer for a full-time position. It is my first IT position and job. Working over the summer was bareable because that was my only priority aside from my family and once my shift was done, I could go home a rest. Once school started, I started having a tough time.

Sitting in a chair for 8 hours at work with my bad back and neck can be a challenge. Everyday all I can think of at the end of my shift is to make it home to lay down on my bed and ease the pain. My class absences are due to that particular reason.

Working full-time and taking two classes this semester while enduring chronic pain have been the biggest challenge to me this year. I realize that I must find a way to manage my chronic pain if I am to continue education while working a full-time position.

I know I don't deserve a A or a B in this class, the reason why I expect a C- is because I have completed a few assignments as well as made some minor contributions to AbantOS.
